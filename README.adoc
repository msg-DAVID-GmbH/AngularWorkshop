= Angular Workshop
These are my notes and code snippets from the Udemy Workshop https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2[The complete guide to Angular].

== Introduction
* Angular = framework for reactive single-page-applications
** single-page = one HTML-file that gets changed by JS
** reactive = not necessarily a server-call (and if, can be done in the background)
* version madness
** "Angular.js" = Angular 1 = first version of framework
** "Angular 2" = first major rewrite, also known as simply "Angular"
** "Angular 3" skipped for some reason
** "Angular 4" and "Angular 5" = latest versions
** however, only two major and potentially incompatible versions: Angular.js and "the rest" a.k.a. "Angular" because only Angular 2 had major changes

== Setup
* following steps are for Windows machines; Linux can slightly diver

=== Install NodeJS
* https://nodejs.org/en/
* ... because Angular CLI needs it ...
* manages packages and loads a local development server

=== Install Angular CLI
* builds new projects that can than be used
* less setup, less writing boiler plate, more coding business logic
* in console:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

* npm = Node package manager, came with NodeJS
* -g = global install
* @angular/cli = package

=== Create new Angular Project
* create new folder and navigate to it in console
* creating new project:

    ng new my-first-app

* my-first-app is the name of the app

=== Run project
* navigate in created folder and run

    ng serve

* will build all source code and run a dev server (see output for address)
