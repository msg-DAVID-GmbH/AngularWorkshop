These are my notes and code snippets from the Udemy Workshop https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2[The complete guide to Angular].

== Introduction
* Angular = framework for reactive single-page-applications
** single-page = one HTML-file that gets changed by JS
** reactive = not necessarily a server-call (and if, can be done in the background)
* version madness
** "Angular.js" = Angular 1 = first version of framework
** "Angular 2" = first major rewrite, also known as simply "Angular"
** "Angular 3" skipped for some reason
** "Angular 4" and "Angular 5" = latest versions
** however, only two major and potentially incompatible versions: Angular.js and "the rest" a.k.a. "Angular" because only Angular 2 had major changes

== Setup
* following steps are for Windows machines; Linux can slightly diver

=== Install NodeJS
* https://nodejs.org/en/
* ... because Angular CLI needs it ...
* manages packages and loads a local development server

=== Install Angular CLI
* builds new projects that can than be used
* less setup, less writing boiler plate, more coding business logic
* in Windows console:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

* npm = Node package manager, came with NodeJS
* -g = global install
* @angular/cli = package

=== Create new Angular Project
* create new folder and navigate to it in console
* creating new project (in Windows console):

    ng new my-first-app

* my-first-app is the name of the app
* overview of what will be created:
** folder e2e contains end-to-end testing
** folder src/app should be the only location changes should be applied to
** src/index.html = HTML file that is changed by the Java Script of the framework
** README.md contains the most important commands
** other single files = configuration; no need to touch ... maybe later
** ending "ts" is  for "type script" because this superset of Java Script, which is a new statically typed programming language on top of Java Script, is used in Angular

=== Run project
* navigate in created folder and run (in Windows console)

    ng serve

* will build all source code and run a dev server (see output for address)
* should be kept running all the time because changes in files are automatically saved, compiled and the app refreshed in the browser (without the need to hit F5!)

== Tooling
* https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm] is a lightweight IntelliJ IDEA and is suited for web development right away. However, IntelliJ IDEA https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13827214/can-intellij-idea-encapsulate-all-of-the-functionality-of-webstorm-and-phpstorm/13829907#13829907[can be upgraded via plugins to offer nearly the same functionality.]
* Creating new Angular and/or Angular CLI project possible via WebStorm. Maybe the better way to create new projects in the future.
* WebStorm supports Angular:

= Open Questions and Tasks
* Switch from WebStorm to IntelliJ IDEA
** find out if IntelliJ also supports Angular like WebStorm / what to do to make it so
** find out if occurrences / usages of variables defined in app.component.ts are are searchable via Alt + F7. This is possible in WebStorm and absolutely awesome.
* can the "ng serve" command be executed from within WebStorm, so I don't have to leave the IDE?
* move the example project to this repository
