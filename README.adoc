= Angular Workshop
These are my notes and code snippets from the Udemy Workshop https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2[The complete guide to Angular].

== Introduction
* Angular = framework for reactive single-page-applications
** single-page = one HTML-file that gets changed by JS
** reactive = not necessarily a server-call (and if, can be done in the background)
* version madness
** "Angular.js" = Angular 1 = first version of framework
** "Angular 2" = first major rewrite, also known as simply "Angular"
** "Angular 3" skipped for some reason
** "Angular 4" and "Angular 5" = latest versions
** however, only two major and potentially incompatible versions: Angular.js and "the rest" a.k.a. "Angular" because only Angular 2 had major changes

== Angular CLI
* builds new projects that can than be used
* less setup, less writing boiler plate, more coding business logic
