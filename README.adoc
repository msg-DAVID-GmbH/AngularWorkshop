These are my notes and code snippets from the Udemy Workshop https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2[The complete guide to Angular].

== Introduction
* Angular = framework for reactive single-page-applications
** single-page = one HTML-file that gets changed by JS
** reactive = not necessarily a server-call (and if, can be done in the background)
* version madness
** "Angular.js" = Angular 1 = first version of framework
** "Angular 2" = first major rewrite, also known as simply "Angular"
** "Angular 3" skipped for some reason
** "Angular 4" and "Angular 5" = latest versions
** however, only two major and potentially incompatible versions: Angular.js and "the rest" a.k.a. "Angular" because only Angular 2 had major changes

== Setup
* following steps are for Windows machines; Linux can slightly diver

=== Install NodeJS
* https://nodejs.org/en/
* ... because Angular CLI needs it ...
* manages packages and loads a local development server

=== Install Angular CLI
* builds new projects that can than be used
* less setup, less writing boiler plate, more coding business logic
* in Windows console:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

* npm = Node package manager, came with NodeJS
* -g = global install
* @angular/cli = package

=== Create new Angular Project
* create new folder and navigate to it in console
* creating new project (in Windows console):

    ng new my-first-app

* my-first-app is the name of the app
* overview of what will be created:
** folder e2e contains end-to-end testing
** folder src/app should be the only location changes should be applied to
** src/index.html = HTML file that is changed by the Java Script of the framework
** folder node_modules is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34526844/what-is-node-modules-directory-in-angularjs[just for build tools] and contains for example downloaded content like Bootstrap. Hence this is excluded in the .gitignore. These files are not necessary for deployment on server, just for development. For deployment, the content is bundled into one single file by the CLI.
** README.md contains the most important commands
** other single files = configuration; no need to touch ... maybe later

=== Run project
* navigate in created folder and run (in Windows console)

    ng serve

* will build all source code and run a dev server (see output for address)
* should be kept running all the time because changes in files are automatically saved, compiled and the app refreshed in the browser (without the need to hit F5!)

== Tooling
* IntelliJ IDEA supports Angular right from the start:

* Reference search also working:

image::referenceSearchInIDEA.png[]

* also, https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm] is a lightweight IntelliJ IDEA and is suited for web development right away. However, IntelliJ IDEA https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13827214/can-intellij-idea-encapsulate-all-of-the-functionality-of-webstorm-and-phpstorm/13829907#13829907[can be upgraded via plugins to offer nearly the same functionality.]

== TypeScript
* Angular uses TypeScript: files ending with "ts"
* superset of Java Script, which is a new statically, strongly-typed programming language on top of Java Script
* doesn't run in the browser, has to be compiled - that's what the CLI is for!

== Bootstrap
* https://getbootstrap.com[Bootstrap] = toolkit for HTML, CSS and JS
* in the course, Bootstrap 3 is used. Hence use

[source]
----
    npm install --save bootstrap@3
----

instead of

[source]
----
    npm install --save bootstrap
----

* run this in IntelliJ IDEA via build-in Terminal will download Bootstrap
* after downloading, it has to be imported:
** open .angular-cli.json
** add something to the array of styles:

[source,json]
----
    "styles": [
            "styles.css"
          ],
----
** add newly downloaded Bootstrap-style from directory node_modules:
----
    "styles": [
            "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css",
            "styles.css"
          ],
----

= Open Questions and Tasks
* can the "ng serve" command be executed from within WebStorm, so I don't have to leave the IDE?
